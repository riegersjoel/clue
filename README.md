# clue
A simple implementation of the board game clue

This is a small application i used to learn JavaScript.
Now that i'm learning React, this would have been a lot easier,
but it was a neat little project to learn the basics of how to 
implement simple algorithms, handle Arrays and Objects and update
the DOM with Vanilla JavaScript.
